<h1>AVR Network Server</h1> 
<hr /> 
<div class="shadow"></div>
<p>If you are reading this, the AVR web server is up and running. If you've spent a whole week building this device, it is time to give yourself a pat on the back. :-)</p>
<p>In short, you are now looking a web page that is generated using Atmel ATMega644, which is interfaced with NE2000 compatible ISA (..or PC/104) network adapter. The TCP/IP stack is a part of AVR's program. The implementation supports UDP, TCP and ICMP (only echo/ping) protocols.</p>
<p>The code is written by Arto Meriläinen during 2006 - 2011. Some parts of the code are copied from my previous projects, which explains the long history.</p>
